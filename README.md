## Application Description
Evergreen Budgeting is a personal budgeting application created for my Level 4 Individual Project at the University of Glasgow, under the supervision of Dr Sofiat Olaosebikan.

The application contains an Angular frontend and a Node.js server and makes use of a PostgreSQL database.

Evergreen Budgeting allows users to create a category-based budget, track spending and income, set savings goals, and generate reports on their financial activity.
